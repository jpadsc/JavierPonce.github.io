Hello! As you probably already figured out, My name is Javier Ponce, and I made this website for anyone interested in learning more about who I am and the things that I find fascinating about life. Hopefully, you are reading this because you are an interested Employer or a prospective friend, and ideally, you are both.

# About Me

I consider myself a creative, passionate, and curious individual fascinated by Mathematics. I currently pursue my fascination for Mathematics at the University of California San Diego, working towards completing the Probability and Statistics major, the Economics major, and the Data Science minor.
