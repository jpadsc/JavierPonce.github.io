Hello! As you probably already figured out, My name is Javier Ponce, and I made this website for anyone interested in learning more about who I am and the things that I find fascinating about life. Hopefully, you are reading this because you are a prospective friend or an interested Employer, and ideally, you are both.

# About Me

I consider myself a creative, passionate, and curious mind fascinated by Mathematics and how to understand random processes with mathematical modeling. I am pursuing my passion for Mathematics at the University of California San Diego, where I am working towards completing a degree with a Probability and Statistics major, an Economics major, and a Data Science minor. 

While I enjoy learning about abstract Mathematics, my creative mind impels me to merge what I observe with the mathematical principles I know. The other day, after spending a lot of time with my dog Leia, I noticed that she has four moods: resting, eating, playing, and going outside (equivalent to going to the restroom). Since I wish to predict when Leia might want to go outside, I wondered if I could create a Markov chain that accurately describes Leia's behavior and use it to predict if Leia wants to go outside at some given moment. Hopefully, you can see that I enjoy formulating and solving questions that merge my reality with Mathematics, which pushes me to use my education and experience to seek a living out of it.
