## No more watermelon sugar.

I don't like watermelon. Naturally, I also dislike watermelon-flavored candy, but for some reason, whenever I enjoy a bag of Life Savers gummies, I feel as if the majority of the gummies I pull out of the bag are watermelon-flavored. This feeling made me wonder if the five flavors included in the bag appeared in equal proportions, and if watermelon-flavored gummies were as abundant as I perceived them to be. Thus, after finishing the bag that sparked all these questions in me, I ran to the store to buy more Life Savers to perform statistical tests on the samples from the new bags.

## The parameters of interest and the Data.

Contrary to what the AI-generated header image depicts, the Life Savers gummies I consume in the US come in five flavors: Cherry (dark red), Strawberry (light red), Green Apple (dark green), Watermelon (light green), and Orange. Then we can define $p_{C}$, $p_{S}$, $p_{A}$, $p_{W}$, and $p_{O}$ to be the proportions of produced gummies that are each flavor, respectively.
