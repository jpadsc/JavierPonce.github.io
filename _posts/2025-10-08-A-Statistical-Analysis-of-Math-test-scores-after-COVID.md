## Did COVID make students attempting to go to college worse at math?

As a student who experienced the online classes era during COVID, I believe that online schooling significantly decreased learning among all students, especially in abstract subjects like mathematics. Similarly, during my years as a Mathematics and Data Science tutor at UCSD, I found that many students struggled due to a lack of understanding of fundamental concepts they had studied during the COVID pandemic. Driven by this belief, I started looking for relevant data to run statistical tests on.

Ideally, when you want to test a causal effect like the one I described in the above paragraph, you would seek data that allows you to hold all variables constant while changing the variable that causes the effect. Finding such data would require students who were and weren’t affected by the COVID pandemic at the same time, which is impossible without access to a parallel reality where COVID didn’t happen. Instead, we can compare how students performed during math tests before and after the pandemic. While such a comparison won't prove causality, if we don’t find any statistically significant change in performance, then it doesn’t make sense to hold a belief that is not somehow reflected in our reality. Thus, I decided to run statistical tests on data from the SAT yearly reports from 2020 to 2025.

## The parameters of interest and the Data.

Before running any tests, let me define the parameters of interest and explain how we can use the data from the yearly SAT reports to test the defined parameters. I’ll define $\mu_x$ to be the average math SAT score obtained by students planning to attend college during the school cycle $x$ in the hypothetical case where all of them took the test. For simplicity, let each school cycle be represented by the latter year of each cycle, meaning that $\mu_{2025}$ represents the true average score of all students planning to apply to college in the 2025-2024 cycle if we were to test all of these students. Under these definitions, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that  $\mu_x < \mu_y$, where $x$ represents a school cycle after the COVID lockdown and $y$ the one before it. 

Since not all students planning to attend college in each school cycle take the SAT, the data from the SAT yearly reports is from a sample of our population of interest.
